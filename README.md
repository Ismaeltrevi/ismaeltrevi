I'm Ismael, a Data Scientist based in New York, NY, and passionate about solving problems and tell stories through data. With a background in Marketing and Business Intelligence, I focused on data-driven decisions and solutions.<br>

Invite me for a hot coffee (black, please) and a conversation about that new machine learning algorithm that you just learned about, and we will be best friends. You can find me running by the river or reading about astrophysics at public parks in NYC in my free time.
