I'm Ismael, a Data Scientist based in New York, NY and passionate about solving problems and tell stories through data. With a background in Marketing and Business Intelligence, I always made sure to transform any department where I worked into a data-driven one.

Invite me for a hot coffee (black, please) and a conversation about that new machine learning algorithm that you just learned about and we will be best friends.

In my free time, you can find me running by the river or reading about astrophysics at public parks.
