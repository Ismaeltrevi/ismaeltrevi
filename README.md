I'm Ismael, a Data Scientist based in New York, NY, and passionate about solving problems and tell stories through data. With a background in Marketing and Business Intelligence, I focused on data-driven decisions and solutions.
Invite me for a hot coffee (black, please) and a conversation about that new machine learning algorithm that you just learned about, and we will be best friends.
<br><br>You can find me running by the river, reading about astrophysics at public parks in NYC in my free time, or translating Data Science courses from English to Portuguese.
